## Abstract 

Nearly one billion people suffer from a mental health condition. A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.  It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.

Using data from Our World in Data[¹](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health), machine learning was applied to predict the percentage of the population that will suffer a mental health condition in the 2030 to 2080. These predictions could be used to recognize and develop ways to help the rising amount of people in the population with a mental health condition. Using tableau, we were able to relate the percentage of those with mental health conditions to -----

The results show that ----


## Introduction

We can all be "sad" or "blue" at times in our lives. We have all seen movies about the madman and his crime spree, with the underlying cause of mental illness. We sometimes even make jokes about people being crazy or nuts, even though we know that we shouldn't. We have all had some exposure to mental illness, but not many understand or know what it is. **A mental illness can be defined as a health condition that changes a person's thinking, feelings, or behavior (or all three) and that causes the person distress and difficulty in functioning.** As with many diseases, mental illness is severe in some cases and mild in others. Individuals who have a mental illness don't necessarily look like they are sick, especially if their illness is mild. Other individuals may show more explicit symptoms such as confusion, agitation, or withdrawal. There are many different mental illnesses, including depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Each illness alters a person's thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors in distinct ways.[²](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20369/) In this project, we will exploring the prevalence of mental health disorders throughout the world.

According to the World Health Organisation more than 970 million (1 in 8) people live in the world with a mental disorder.[³](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders) Most suicides are related to psychiatric disease, with depression, substance use disorders and psychosis being the most relevant risk factors. However, anxiety, personality-, eating-, and trauma-related disorders, as well as organic mental disorders, also contribute.[⁴](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165520/)

## Goal

Many people hold misconceptions about mental health and through this project we are hoping to address and correct the stigma surrounding mental health.
The goal of this project is to analyse data about countries affected by several mental health disorders including: depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse, in order to predict the percentages of the population that will experience a mental health disorder in future years.

## Data

The data for this project is from Kaggle and was gathered from an article on Our World in Data[¹](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) and produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The data demonstrates that mental health disorders are common everywhere. Improving awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health. 
The data can be found at this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/mental-health-dataset?select=share-with-mental-or-substance-disorders-by-sex.csv

For this project, data was taken from the years between 1989 and 2022 and consisted of worldwide geospatial coverage.

## Apprach

The approach for this project was to create a Linear Regression model to ----. Using these predicted values we created Tableau vizualisations to compare and contrast -----

## Methods

The data was scaled  with the goal of increasing accuracy of the models. The model was first trained and fitted with default parameters as a base. ------------------

## Results

## Future Directions

- <b>Try different models.</b> Predicting mental health disorder prevalency is a complex and multidimensional problem so it is not surprising that it is difficult to model. Perhaps exploring more model types could reveal a strategy that was just right for this task. A neural network, for example, could open up a huge range of possibilities that have not been explored in this project. The downside of neural networks is of course the lack of transparency in what features the model is using to make predictions.
