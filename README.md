## Summary

## Introduction
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgement of the important role mental health plays in achieving global development goals; despite this progress in some countries, mental health is still a heavily stigmatised topic. (CDC.org, WHO.int)

In this project we will be analysing the prevalence of mental health disorders across different countries from the 1990s to the 2020s.
We will also be using this data to predict the prevelence mental health disorders across those countries in future years.
We will clean the data using python and combine the DataFrames using SQL. 
We will use the cleaned data to train a ML model that can predict the future prevalence of mental health disorders around the world including: depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, sleeping disorders, etc.
We will then use the analysed data to create visualisations that can better illustrate our findings. 

The analysis should help us derive meaningful conclusions from the data.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
We have used one dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/mental-health-dataset?select=share-with-mental-or-substance-disorders-by-sex.csv
